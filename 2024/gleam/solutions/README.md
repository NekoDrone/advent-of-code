## Advent of Code / 2024 / Gleam

To see the solutions in action, perform the following.

1. Get some data from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
2. Create a folder in the root of the `gleam/solutions` folder (the folder that contains this readme) titled `input/2024`.
3. Create an `X.txt` file where X is the challenge for that day.
4. Alternatively, run `gleam run new X` to create this for you.
5. Paste the input data you obtained into the file.
6. Run `gleam run run X` to run the solution for that day, or `gleam run run all` to run all solutions provided you have given the appropriate inputs.
